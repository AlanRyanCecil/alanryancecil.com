                    </a>
                    <p>In 2016, the United States spent nearly twice as much as 10 high-income countries on medical care and performed less well on many population health outcomes. Contrary to some explanations for high spending, social spending and health care utilization in the United States did not differ substantially from other high-income nations.</p>

                    <p>Healthy People 2020, which establishes the health agenda for the United States, promotes a societal vision whereby all individuals lead long healthy lives free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death. Yet new evidence in this issue of JAMA finds that vision well beyond the reach of far too many people.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that the burden of death and disease from tobacco use in the United States is overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and other combusted tobacco products. Cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product among U.S. adults, and about 480,000 U.S. deaths per year are caused by cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke exposure.</p>
